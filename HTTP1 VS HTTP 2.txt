The Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) is a communication protocol used to transfer data over the internet. It's the foundation of the World Wide Web and the backbone of modern web communication. The latest version of HTTP is HTTP/2, which was released in May 2015. It replaced HTTP/1.1, which had been in use since 1999. In this blog, we will discuss the differences between HTTP/1.1 and HTTP/2.

Multiplexing:
HTTP/2 introduced a new feature called multiplexing, which allows multiple requests to be sent and received on a single connection at the same time. This feature significantly reduces the number of round trips required to load a webpage, resulting in faster load times.

In contrast, HTTP/1.1 uses a single request/response model, which means that only one request can be sent and processed at a time on a single connection. This model can lead to slower load times, especially for complex web pages that require multiple requests.

Binary Protocol:
HTTP/2 uses a binary protocol, which means that data is sent in binary format rather than human-readable text. This format is more efficient and faster to parse, resulting in better performance. In contrast, HTTP/1.1 uses a text-based protocol, which can lead to slower load times due to the extra processing required to convert the text to binary format.

Server Push:
HTTP/2 introduced a new feature called server push, which allows the server to push resources to the client before the client requests them. This feature can significantly improve page load times by reducing the number of requests required to load a page.

In contrast, HTTP/1.1 does not support server push, which means that all resources must be explicitly requested by the client, resulting in slower load times.

Header Compression:
HTTP/2 uses header compression to reduce the size of header information, which can account for a significant portion of the total data sent in a request. This compression reduces the amount of data that needs to be sent over the network, resulting in faster load times.

In contrast, HTTP/1.1 does not support header compression, which can lead to slower load times due to the larger amount of data that needs to be sent over the network.

Prioritization:
HTTP/2 supports request prioritization, which allows the client to specify the order in which requests should be processed. This feature can significantly improve page load times by ensuring that critical resources are loaded first.

In contrast, HTTP/1.1 does not support request prioritization, which means that resources are loaded in the order in which they are requested, which can lead to slower load times.

Conclusion:

HTTP/2 is a significant improvement over HTTP/1.1, with features such as multiplexing, binary protocol, server push, header compression, and prioritization. These features can result in faster load times, better performance, and improved user experience. It's important to note that not all web servers and clients support HTTP/2, so it's essential to check the compatibility before implementing it on a website.
